# Hey, I’m Christian 👋  

I’m a **Data Scientist** with a hands-on background in IT and repair, now focused on building **AI and machine learning systems that actually make a difference**.  
I don’t just work with data, I **build with purpose**, even if it means creating the path myself.  

## 🚀 What I’m About
- Exploring how **reasoning, structure, and emergent behavior** can shape the future of AI (see [Project Gestalt](#))  
- Applying machine learning to **real-world problems** like fraud detection, education, and marketing analytics  
- Always pushing through challenges — growth comes from working on the hard stuff  

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With
- **Languages:** Python, R, C++  
- **ML/AI:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (exploring), Random Forests, ANN  
- **Data Tools:** pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas, dplyr, ggplot2  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2  
- **Workflow:** Jupyter, R Markdown, Google Cloud, GitHub  

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Advanced ML techniques (regularization, ensembles, neural architectures)  
- Cloud-based data engineering (Google Cloud, PySpark, Dataproc)  
- Building reasoning-focused AI systems (Graph Neural Networks, symbolic logic integrations)  

## ✨ Outside the Code
I’m driven by curiosity, persistence, and the belief that tech should **bring people back to their humanity** — not replace it. Whether it’s experimenting with AI projects, learning new frameworks, or reflecting on bigger ideas, I’m always chasing growth.
